    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Parmesan, also known as Chicken Parmigiana, is a beloved Italian-American dish that combines crispy breaded chicken with rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. 
        It begins with boneless, skinless chicken breasts that are pounded thin, then coated in flour, dipped in beaten eggs, and dredged in seasoned breadcrumbs. 
        The chicken is pan-fried until golden and crispy, locking in moisture and flavor. 
        It’s then topped with marinara sauce—made from simmered tomatoes, garlic, onions, and Italian herbs—and a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
        The dish is baked until the cheese is melted, bubbly, and slightly golden. 
        The result is a comforting meal with a perfect balance of crunchy coating, tender chicken, tangy sauce, and cheesy richness.
        Chicken Parmesan is often served over a bed of spaghetti or other pasta, though it can also be enjoyed with a side of garlic bread, salad, or even in a sandwich. 
        It’s a staple in Italian-American cuisine and a favorite at family dinners and casual restaurants. Whether homemade or ordered out, Chicken Parmesan offers familiar, satisfying flavors in every bite.
