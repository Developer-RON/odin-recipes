    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Molasses cookies are soft, chewy treats known for their deep, rich flavor and warm spices. 
        These cookies are made with dark molasses, which gives them their signature sweetness and slightly smoky taste. 
        They have a soft, almost cake-like texture with a crackled surface, often coated in sugar for an added sparkle and crunch. 
        The dough is typically spiced with ground ginger, cinnamon, and cloves, creating a cozy, nostalgic flavor perfect for the fall and winter seasons.
        Molasses cookies are especially popular around the holidays, often enjoyed with a cup of tea, coffee, or a glass of milk. 
        Their warm aroma while baking fills the kitchen with comforting scents, making them a favorite for home bakers. 
        Whether served plain or used to sandwich cream fillings, molasses cookies offer a timeless taste thatâ€™s both bold and comforting.
